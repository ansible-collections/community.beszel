  Release 0.5.0 of the Ansible community collection for Beszel.

minor_changes:
  - community.beszel.agent - Enhanced authentication validation logic to ensure 'agent_public_key' is always required, and 'agent_hub_url' must be provided when using 'agent_token' authentication.
  - community.beszel.agent - Enhanced README documentation with additional information about authentication variables and their requirements.
  - community.beszel.agent - Improve documentation of example playbooks.
  - community.beszel.agent - Add support for air-gapped deployment mode via the 'agent_airgap' variable. When enabled, the Beszel binary agent is copied from the Ansible Controller instead of being downloaded from GitHub, enabling deployment in disconnected or restricted network environments.
  - Add AGENTS.md to instruct AI agents how to perform development tasks within this project.
